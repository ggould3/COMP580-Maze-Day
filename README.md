# COMP580-Maze-Day
This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids, redesigned to be playable without the use of sight.  The user defends a central point by rotating left and right to face and shoot asteroids according to spatial audio cues that place the asteroids in 3D space around the player.  This project was demoed at UNC Maze Day 2017.
